# mcnet_pytorch
## Paper
It is the pytorch re-implementation of ICLR2017 paper [Decomposing Motion and Content for Natural Video Sequence Prediction](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rkEFLFqee) by Ruben Villegas, Jimei Yang, Seunghoon Hong, Xunyu Lin and Honglak Lee.

Follow the following instruction to use it.

## Install dependences
The code is in Python 2 and you need pip, homebrew to install dependences.

Suggest to use [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) and install all the dependences in this virtual environment to avoid the confliction with your original environment.

Use requirements.txt to get all dependences.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
